# runs are executed in the same order as in this file
# the second field tells which test should be run in order to compare with the last available output
# e.g. 0 means do not compare anything, running is enough
#      1 compares the last total energy in the file
#      8 compares the first frequency in the last vibration line in the file
#      for details see cp2k/tools/do_regtest
# Mode selectiv vibrational analysis and intensities

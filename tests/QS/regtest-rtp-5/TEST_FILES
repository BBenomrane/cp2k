# runs are executed in the same order as in this file
# the second field tells which test should be run in order to compare with the last available output
# e.g. 0 means do not compare anything, running is enough
#      1 compares the last total energy in the file

# Description: 
# Restart using densitry propagation method from GS calculation. 
# Note: A delta kick is required in the input but should not impact the calculation (delta kick + restart from wfn not implemented yet).
#
# 'simple molecule': Testing the different possibility to apply delta pulses
